The version I finished is in R/S+, I realize that Python is faster/flexible/popular.
I am rewriting it in Python now but I WOULD COMPLETELY IGNORE THIS CODE IN FAVOR OF THE R CODE.

When I work in Windows, I am using WinPython-64bit-3.3.3.3 which comes with (and auto-loads) numpy.
It is free, so if you use windows and can't follow my work I recommend that you install that (and run Spyder.exe).
