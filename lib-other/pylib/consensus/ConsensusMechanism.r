#Notes

#Voting Across Time
#Later Votes could count more
#! ...simple change = DecisionOutcome.Final becomes exponentially smoothed result of previous chains.
#! require X number of chains (blocks) before the outcome is officially determined .. or, continue next round if ~ .5, or Decisions.Raw is within a threshold ( .2 to .8)
# Would need:
# 1] Percent Voted
# 2] Time Dimension of blocks.
