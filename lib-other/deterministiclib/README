This version is different in these ways:
1) It only supports binary, not scalar. ( I am planning on adding scalar eventually.)
2) It doesn't use vectors for graphics card oprimization, so it is much slower.
3) It requires installing the cdecimal python library (but not R or numpy)
4) It is deterministic, so Macs and Windows and Linux all get identical outcomes. We avoid floating point operations.

The 4th property is the most important one. That is why this is the only version so far that can be used in a blockchain.
